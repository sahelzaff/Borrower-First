                First figured out a way to help him save about 2.5% on his interest rates, which was a significant
                amount considering their loans. The freed-up cash after refinancing their debt was a great relief for
                him, his wife and his business. At the end of it all, we helped Rob save almost $40,000 in his loan
                repayments in the first year! Rob said that with this newly gained financial freedom, for the first time
                in a long time, they were looking to book an overseas holiday that they had put off for a long while.
